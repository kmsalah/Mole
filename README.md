## Mole

### Can search a page for all the PDF links it has and then search each of those PDFs for a keyword

#### Usage
``` 
python mole.py 'webpagelink' '1keyword'
``` 
#### Prints out a list of all relevant PDF links

#### todo:
* Support multiple keywords
* Handle errors rather than skipping over


##### It did what I needed it to do so probably won't make many changes.
